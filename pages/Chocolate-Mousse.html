    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Chocolate Mousse is a chilled chocolate dessert with an airy texture, is typically made
        from a base of whipped cream and whipped egg whites, sometimes stabilized with gelatin.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>150g <strong>70% dark chocolate,</strong> plus extra to serve</li>
        <li>6 egg whites</li>
        <li>2 tbsp golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>4 tbsp crème fraîche and grated chocolate, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Method</strong></h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Melt the chocolate in the microwave in a microwaveable bowl, stirring every 30 seconds
        until just melted. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, scatter in the sugar and whisk again
        until the mixture forms stiff peaks when you lift the whisk out.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Add a third of the egg white to the melted chocolate and mix vigorously, working fast so 
        the chocolate doesn't cool and harden. Then fold in the remaining egg whites carefully
        using a spatula or large metal spoon. Spoon into 4 glasses or ramekins and set in the 
        fridge for 2-3 hours.
